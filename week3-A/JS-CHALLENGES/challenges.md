Challenges for the morning:
(1) Arrange these array items in alphabetical order and log myArray to the console
let myArray = ["Sam", "Dean", "Stuart", "Leona", "Jacob", “Dan”]

(2) Take the word 'codenation' and rearrange the letters in the word so they are in alphabetical order.
Store the result in a new variable and log it to the console.

(3) Given an array of two numbers you need to write a function which will add together those two numbers AND all the numbers in between them.
For example - if you put [5, 10] into your function it would calculate //5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 then log the result to the console. test your code with [1, 4] which should equal 10 [1, 5] which should equal 15

(4) Write a function that takes one array as a parameter and returns a random item out of the array.
